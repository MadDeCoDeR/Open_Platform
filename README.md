					OPEN PLATFORM
									
Open Platform is a wrapper/interface library for online platforms (eg. Steam,GOG).
The main goal is to allow you to switch between these platforms WITHOUT the need to
change the source code of your own game. 

The library can be dynamicly loaded to your game and work, once loaded call the GetPlatformAPI 
in order to get the library's object and use it in your game.

FAQ:

Q: Will you add support for Matchmaking & lobbies ?

A: Yes, in time.

Q: Will you add DRM check support ?

A: No, the main library (without the use of any platform) is open source.
   If I add DRM check support then any game that will use this library, it
   will be vunerable to piracy. So it's better this to be handled by the
   Developer/Publisher internally.

Q: Is it cross-platform ?

A: Yes, but keep in mind that it has been tested ONLY on Windows & linux.
